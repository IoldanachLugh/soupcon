# FRTCON — Development Context

This document exists to re-establish context for a new development session
(with Claude or otherwise) without needing to replay prior conversation
history. It covers infrastructure, decisions made and why, known gotchas,
and shelved work — things that aren't visible just from reading the code.
For what the app *does* and how the code is organized, see `README.md`.

## What this project is

FRTCON ("French Toast Conditions") is a personal side project: a static
React/Vite app with no backend, that checks live NWS weather alerts for a
location and classifies them into a 5-level "should I make French toast and
stay home" severity scale. Live at frtcon.com. The owner is primarily a
backend developer using this project to build frontend and AI-assisted
development experience — development has been done largely via Claude,
with the owner directing architecture, reviewing/testing, and owning
infrastructure decisions.

## Infrastructure summary

- **Domain**: `frtcon.com`, registered at **Namecheap** (migrated from
  Squarespace registration).
- **DNS**: The `frtcon.com` zone is hosted on **Cloudflare** (free plan).
  Nameservers point to Cloudflare.
- **Traffic routing**: A **Cloudflare Tunnel** named `home-server`
  (tunnel ID begins `dd742d1d-...`) connects the origin server to
  Cloudflare's edge — no public IP is exposed, no port forwarding, no
  dynamic-DNS/ddclient setup was ultimately needed (a tunnel makes that
  moot, since it's an outbound-only connection regardless of the origin's
  IP). Ingress rules (in `config.yml` on the origin server, **not**
  dashboard-managed) route `frtcon.com` and `www.frtcon.com` to Apache on
  `localhost:443`.
- **Origin server**: hostname `elephant`, primary user `frtcon`.
  `cloudflared` runs as its own dedicated system user (`cloudflared`), not
  as `frtcon` — CLI management commands (`cloudflared tunnel list`,
  `route dns`, etc.) must be run as `sudo -u cloudflared cloudflared ...`
  to see the right tunnel/auth context.
- **Web server**: Apache2. Site config lives at
  `/etc/apache2/sites-available/frtcon.conf`, serving from
  `/home/frtcon/public_html`. A **dev instance** exists at
  `public_html/dev` — this is the first place changes get reviewed before
  going to production, not a separate server or deployment target.
- **TLS**: **certbot**, installed via **snap** (not apt — do not have both
  installed simultaneously, they conflict and produce confusing
  "unrecognized arguments" errors). Uses the `certbot-dns-cloudflare`
  plugin (also a separate snap, connected via
  `snap connect certbot:plugin certbot-dns-cloudflare`) for DNS-01
  validation. The certificate covers `frtcon.com` and `www.frtcon.com` as
  SANs. Credentials live in `/etc/letsencrypt/cloudflare.ini`
  (permissions `600`, root-only) — contains a Cloudflare API token scoped
  to `Zone.DNS:Edit` on the `frtcon.com` zone. To add a new hostname to
  the cert later: re-run certbot with the full desired name list,
  `--expand`.

## Frontend architecture & conventions

- React + Vite, **no backend**, no build-time secrets.
- Code is split into modules (see README for the tree):
  `App.jsx` (orchestration only), `lib/` (pure logic + network calls),
  `data/` (static content), `components/`.
- **Styling**: plain CSS in `src/styles.css`, semantic kebab-case class
  names (e.g. `.frtcon-condition-status` for the condition box,
  `.frtcon-badge--level-N` modifier classes for severity colors). No
  CSS-in-JS, no inline `style={}` except for genuinely per-instance
  dynamic values (e.g. each snowflake's randomized position/timing in
  `SnowOverlay.jsx`).
- `lib/frtcon.js` (`classifyAlert`, `determineFrtcon`) is pure — no
  React/DOM dependency — specifically so it's straightforward to unit
  test later, even though no test suite exists yet.
- PWA support exists: `manifest.json`, a no-cache/network-first `sw.js`
  (deliberate — this app shows live alert data, so caching would be
  actively misleading, not just stale), and install-flow UI in the
  hamburger menu (Android gets a real install button via
  `beforeinstallprompt`; iOS gets manual "Add to Home Screen"
  instructions, since no programmatic install API exists on iOS/WebKit,
  ever, at any effort level). The service worker registers at a path
  relative to `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` (so it works whether the build
  is in `public_html/dev` or promoted to the root), but `manifest.json`'s
  `start_url` and `scope` are deliberately left hardcoded to `"/"` — a
  JSON file has no build-time templating, so making those environment-
  aware isn't worth it for a review-only instance. Practical effect:
  install/PWA behavior can't be meaningfully tested from `/dev/`, only
  from production. `sw.js` also catches a failed page navigation (a bare
  `fetch()` failure, notably during Android cold-start before the OS has
  finished bringing the network stack back up) and serves a small
  self-contained "Reconnecting…" page instead of falling through to
  Chrome's own blank-looking offline interstitial — that page retries
  with capped backoff, then gives up with a manual Retry button rather
  than spinning forever on a real outage/airplane-mode; see `public/sw.js`
  for the retry/give-up logic.
- Active alerts are fetched by point (`/alerts/active?point={lat},{lon}`),
  not by forecast zone (`/alerts/active/zone/{zoneId}`) — the zone
  endpoint silently omits alerts issued by county or storm polygon (UGC
  `xxCnnn`) rather than by forecast zone (UGC `xxZnnn`), which includes
  some winter alert types the FRTCON scale relies on (e.g. Snow Squall
  Warning). Confirmed against live NWS data during a 2026-09-14 review:
  several currently-active county/polygon-coded alerts were present via
  `?point=` and absent from the zone endpoint for the same coordinates.
  `getZoneByPoint` (`/points/` → `/zones/forecast/{zoneId}`) is still
  used, just only for the human-readable zone name shown in the UI, not
  for filtering which alerts are shown.
- The app auto-resumes a returning visitor's last-used lookup method
  (browser geolocation vs. ZIP) on load, tracked via a
  `frtcon_last_source` localStorage key — but that key (and
  `frtcon_last_zip`) is only written once a lookup actually succeeds, and
  the silent auto-resume is skipped entirely if
  `navigator.permissions` reports geolocation as `denied`. (Earlier this
  persisted before the lookup even ran, so a denied permission or a
  nonexistent ZIP got "remembered" as the preferred method and silently
  re-failed on every later visit — a manual click of "Use Browser
  Location" is unaffected either way.)

- **Facebook Share button** (`handleShare` in `App.jsx`). Facebook's
  `sharer.php` accepts only a URL, so the button copies the text to the
  clipboard and opens `sharer.php?u=https://frtcon.com` in a new tab; the
  user pastes. Decisions: (1) the copied text is exactly what the
  `.frtcon-condition-status` box shows (headline, title, the same random
  commentary lines) -- so the random line selection lives in `App.jsx`
  (`frtconMessage`), not inside `FrtconMessage`, so share and display can't
  diverge; footnote omitted. (2) No URL in the copied text -- the link card
  already carries it. (3) Clipboard write runs *before* `window.open()`:
  opening the tab first shifted focus and made Chrome show a "wants to see
  text and images copied to the clipboard" permission prompt. (4) Toast
  after, not a confirm dialog before -- user's choice, to avoid an extra
  click. (5) Plain text only: no way to bold the headline on Facebook
  (Unicode-bold trick was offered and declined). The "f" icon is a
  hand-built SVG, not Meta's official brand asset.

## Agent readiness (added 2026-09-25, after a Cloudflare agent-readiness scan)

The scan flagged: no robots.txt, sitemap, Link headers, AI-discovery DNS,
markdown negotiation, AI crawler rules, or content signals. Addressed in
`public/` (ships with `dist/`):

- `robots.txt` -- `Content-Signal: search=yes, ai-input=yes, ai-train=no`,
  explicit `Disallow` for known training crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, CCBot,
  Google-Extended, Bytespider, Applebot-Extended, meta-externalagent), and a
  `Sitemap:` line. The ai-train=no stance is the owner's policy call; flip
  it there if that changes.
- `sitemap.xml` -- just `/` (single-page app).
- `index.md` + `.htaccess` -- `Accept: text/markdown` on `/` rewrites to
  `index.md` (mod_rewrite), with `Vary: Accept`; `Link` headers advertise
  the sitemap and the markdown alternate. `.htaccess` works because the
  vhost has `AllowOverride All`; every block is `<IfModule>`-guarded. Tested
  against a scratch Apache with curl. There's deliberately no `api-catalog`
  Link: the app has no API of its own.
- **Not done (outside the repo):** AI-discovery DNS records live in the
  Cloudflare zone, and Cloudflare's own "Markdown for Agents"/managed
  robots.txt/AI-crawler toggles are dashboard settings. If Cloudflare's
  managed robots.txt is ever enabled it may prepend/override the file above.

## Known gotchas (things that already bit us once)

- **Never set a custom `User-Agent` header on `fetch()` calls to
  api.weather.gov.** Chrome/Firefox silently ignore it, but Safari
  (all iOS browsers, since iOS mandates WebKit) sends it as a real
  header, which fails NWS's CORS preflight and breaks every request
  specifically on iPhone. This was already added once, caused exactly
  this bug, and was removed — don't re-add it without a server-side
  proxy to hold it instead.
- **Static file permissions must be world-readable (644, correct
  owner:group matching the rest of the deployed site) or Apache silently
  fails to serve them.** This specifically broke the PWA manifest/service
  worker/icons once (root-owned 600 files) with no visible error — Chrome
  just never fired `beforeinstallprompt`, with nothing to indicate why.
- **Don't install certbot via both snap and apt simultaneously** — the
  DNS plugin snap only registers with the snap `certbot` binary; a
  coexisting apt install causes "unrecognized arguments" errors that look
  like a plugin problem but are actually a PATH/installation conflict.
- **`cloudflared tunnel login`'s resulting `cert.pem` is scoped to a
  single zone**, chosen at authorization time. Running
  `cloudflared tunnel route dns` for a hostname in a zone that wasn't
  authorized doesn't error clearly — it silently creates a garbage
  record by concatenating the hostname onto whichever zone it does have
  access to, rather than the intended one. If another domain/zone is ever
  added to this account or tunnel, re-run `tunnel login` and explicitly
  authorize the additional zone before routing hostnames in it.
- A one-off layout report (iOS: right-side margin missing) turned out to
  be a **caching artifact**, not a real CSS bug — confirmed via incognito
  testing. Worth ruling out caching first for any "looks different on a
  specific device" report before assuming it's a real rendering issue.
- **This project's dev shell may have an older system Node than the
  toolchain needs.** Vite 8 (and therefore `npm run dev`/`build`/`test`)
  requires Node `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`; a shell with only Node 18.19.1
  fails two different ways: `vite build`/`vitest` themselves throw
  (`node:util` doesn't export `styleText` until Node 20), and — separately
  — `npm install` run under Node 18's bundled npm (9.x) can silently skip
  installing a platform-specific optional native binding (e.g.
  `@rolldown/binding-linux-x64-gnu`), a known npm bug
  (npm/cli#4828), leaving `node_modules` broken even for a later
  newer-Node run until it's reinstalled. Fix used here: no system-level
  Node upgrade, no sudo — just download a Node 20+ linux-x64 tarball
  from nodejs.org to a scratch/temp location and prefix `PATH` with its
  `bin/` dir for `npm install` (fixes both problems at once, since it also
  swaps in a newer bundled npm) and for `dev`/`build`/`test` afterward.
  `node_modules` itself, once (re)installed this way, is fine to keep using
  from the project directory — only the *install* step needs the newer
  Node/npm, not necessarily every subsequent command, though `build`/`test`
  still need Node 20+ at runtime too since that's a hard `vite`/`vitest`
  requirement, not just an install-time one.
- **Service workers update lazily, not on next deploy.** Shipping a new
  `sw.js` doesn't mean a device picks it up the next time the app opens —
  the *old* SW instance is still active and controlling the page. The
  update cycle is: new SW installs in the background on the next visit →
  `skipWaiting()`/`clients.claim()` force it to take over on that load →
  but in practice this can mean the app needs to be fully closed and
  reopened **twice** after a `sw.js` deploy before the new one is actually
  active. To force it immediately for testing, uninstall and reinstall the
  PWA rather than assuming one relaunch is enough to confirm a fix (or a
  regression) in service-worker behavior specifically.

## Deliberately decided against (don't re-litigate without new info)

- **Cloudflare Bot Fight Mode**: left off. No login/payment/auth surface
  on FRTCON itself for it to meaningfully protect, and the Free-tier
  version has no exception/allowlist mechanism, with a known false-positive
  track record.
- **Native app / App Store distribution**: considered and rejected as
  disproportionate. The PWA install flow (manifest + service worker) gets
  most of the practical benefit without App Store review/cost/maintenance.
- **Dynamic per-state home-screen icon** (different icon graphic per
  FRTCON level, auto-refreshing): confirmed **not possible** on the web
  platform at all, on either OS, at any level of engineering effort — no
  API lets a web app swap its own installed icon post-install. The
  Badging API (`navigator.setAppBadge`) is the closest real capability
  (a small number/dot overlay, not a full icon swap) if revisited.

## Shelved for later (not started, but scoped)

- **Web Share API on mobile** (native share sheet carrying condition text +
  link). The Facebook Share button itself is built (see below); this
  mobile variant is not.
- **Server-rendered share previews.** Agreed shape: accept ZIP or
  coordinates as URL parameters, server-render the initial page using
  those inputs, and set Open Graph meta tags to match the resulting
  condition — so a shared link's preview (and the link itself) reflects
  a specific real location, and doubles as a genuinely useful "check this
  location" link for whoever receives it. Requires moving off a purely
  static/client-rendered model — this is the prerequisite for both this
  and the next item.
- **Push notifications** for badge/condition updates while the app isn't
  open (not just on open). Requires a small backend that polls NWS on a
  schedule and pushes updates to subscribed clients.
- **Affiliate integration** (Walmart and/or Amazon) for winter-gear /
  French-toast-adjacent products. Walmart's affiliate program was applied
  for; requires no business entity (individual + SSN/W-9 is sufficient).
  Walmart's "Recipes and Bundle API" is a good fit given it can map an
  ingredient list (the recipe already on-site) to purchasable products.
  Any product-API-based approach (Walmart or Amazon PA-API) requires a
  server-side credential proxy — the API keys involved cannot be exposed
  client-side the way an AdSense publisher ID or Google Analytics ID can.
  Google AdSense itself was also discussed as a simpler, contextual-only
  (not manually curated) alternative if a full product-API integration
  ends up being more than it's worth.

All three shelved items converge on the same prerequisite: introducing a
real backend/server-rendering layer. Worth treating as one combined
migration rather than three separate ones when the time comes.
